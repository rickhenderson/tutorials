# InDesign Basics
A collection of links on how to use Adobe InDesign based on what I need at the moment.

The HTML Links are help for InDesign CS6 but much of the information is the same. You can also find a collection of PDF reference manuals at [InDesign Help Topics](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/topics.html).

The PDF for InDesign CC is located [here](http://helpx.adobe.com/pdf/indesign_reference.pdf)

## Design and Format
### Using Master Pages
Master pages allow you to apply a single design to multiple pages in your document. Changes made to the master will be applied to all pages in the document that share the same master.
